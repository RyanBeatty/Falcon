---------- Functions for Updating the Board ----------

-- | Checks if a move can be made in a specified Column on the Board.
-- | A Move can be made if the first element in the Column is an empty Square
-- | This is because pieces are added to Columns right to left

-- | Places a Square in the next empty slot in a Column.
